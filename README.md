This is a simple shopping list extension that works between different sites. It keeps a list of items, show's their title and product image, 
hyperlinks back to their respective product websites, and u can clear individual or all items in the list, and the lists themselves.
We plan on expanding our project and putting it on a landing page for users to download, as it is a developer mode load unpacked extension at the moment and not on the google extension official page yet.
Adding in features like price per item, price summation, etc... will be for the future.
